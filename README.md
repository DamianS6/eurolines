# eurolines

This is an unfinished app I've been working on during Kiwi.com Python Weekend Course in Bratislava, June 2019. It's purpose was to look for bus connections using data from Eurolines website with given criteria like departure, arrival, luggage, date and so on. </br> This was one of the best projects I could work on, mainly because of the technology stack including:
<ul>
  <li> Flask
  <li> Redis
  <li> Database (PostgreSQL)
  <li> Testing
  <li> HTML
  <li> Web scraping
</ul>

The main features are there (you can't launch the app now beacause of not accessible redis server) but the time given on the course wasn't enough to finish it completely (especially considering the fact that most of the technologies were brand new to me) and I'm still eager to do it in the future.
